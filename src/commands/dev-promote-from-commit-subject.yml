  Uses the CLI to promote a dev version of an orb to the registry.
  This command supports Semantic Versioning support.
  It assumes the context of a GitHub pull request, and promotion of
  the orb to a new major/minor/patch version is
  based on information that must be contained in the subject of
  the commit that merges the pull request.
  Namely, the commit subject must include the `[semver:FOO]` pattern,
  where FOO is major, minor, patch, or skip (to skip promotion).
  e.g. 'Merge pull request #XX from some-branch [semver:minor]'
