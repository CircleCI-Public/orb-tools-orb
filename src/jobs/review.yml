  Automatically reviews your orb for best practices and produces JUnit test reports which are natively displayed in the CircleCI UI.
  The "Review" job checks against a suite of "RC" review checks, and if an opportunity for improvement is found, a suggestion with links to the relevant documentation is made.

parameters:
  exclude:
    description: |
      A comma separated list of "RC" review check codes to explicitly ignore.
      Each review check has an associated "RC" code that can be identified to skip in future tests. If a review check fails, the "RC" code will be included in the output.
      Example: "RC001,RC002"
    type: string
    default: ""
  source_dir:
    description: Path to the orb source. Path must be absolute or relative to the working directory.
    type: string
    default: src
  orb_name:
    type: string
    description: >
      The reference name of the orb to be injected in the config, no namespace or version number. e.g. "orb-tools"
  max_command_length:
    description: |
      The maximum length of a command (RC009).
      This is used to check for commands that are too long.
      Commands longer than this will fail the review.
    type: integer
    default: 64
  checkout:
    type: boolean
    default: true

      If you do not wish to checkout the source code, you may disable this behavior. Replace the checkout and add your own command or steps via the 'pre-steps' parameter in your workflow.
