  Automatically reviews your orb for best practices and produces JUnit test reports which are natively displayed in the CircleCI UI.
  The "Review" job checks against a suite of "RC" review checks, and if an opportunity for improvement is found, a suggestion with links to the relevant documentation is made.

parameters:
  exclude:
    description: |
      A comma separated list of "RC" review check codes to explicitly ignore.

      Example: "RC001,RC002"
