  Uses the CLI to promote a dev version of an orb to the registry.
  This command supports Semantic Versioning support.
  Whether the new release of the orb will be a patch, minor or major
  release is determined based on the information in the commit's git tag
  which must match the regex pattern defined in the major-release-tag-regex,
  minor-release-tag-regex and patch-release-tag-regex parameters.
  Hence this command should be used in a job with an "only" tag filter set to
  the above 3 patterns (e.g. /^(major|minor|patch)-release-v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/ would
  match the default patterns) and a branch filter set to ignore /.*/ .

  Requires bash.
