  After your orb has been packed and published to a dev version, we can load that specific development version in this workflow.
  With the orb loaded, we can run "integration tests" by executing our orbs commands and jobs and validating their output.
  Finally, if the commit has been tagged (ex v1.0.0), we can publish the orb to a production version.
  For advanced usage, see the full docs linked in the "Homepage" url above.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    orb-tools: circleci/orb-tools@11.0
    my-orb: namespace/my-orb@dev:<<pipeline.git.revision>>
  jobs:
    # Create a job to test the commands of your orbs.
    # You may want to add additional validation steps to ensure the commands are working as expected.
    command-tests:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:current
      steps:
        - checkout
        # Run your orb's commands to validate them.
        - my-orb/my-command
        - my-orb/my-command-2
  workflows:
    test-deploy:
      jobs:
        # Test your orb's commands
        - command-tests:
            filters:
              tags:
                only: /.*/
        # If your orb has jobs, they can also be tested prior to publishing.
        - my-orb/my-job:
            filters:
              tags:
                only: /.*/
        # Because our publishing job has a tag filter, we must also apply a filter to each job it depends on.
        - orb-tools/publish-release:
            orb-name: namespace/my-orb
            requires: [command-tests, my-orb/my-job]
