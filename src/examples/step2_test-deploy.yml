  After linting and shellchecking the orb is injected into this config dynamically by the "continue" job and triggered.
  The orb is purposefully not imported here, though it is referenced in the config, it will be dynamically injected.
  With the orb loaded, we can run "integration tests" by executing our orbs commands and jobs and validating their output.
  Finally, if the commit has been tagged (ex v1.0.0), we can publish the orb to a production version.
  For advanced usage, see the full docs linked in the "Homepage" url above.

    # You may want to add additional validation steps to ensure the commands are working as expected.
