  The Orb-Tools orb is typically configured automatically by the Orb Development Kit. After initializing a new orb, this is the configuration file that will be automatically loaded.
  This configuration uses "Dynamic Config" with two different configuration files. In this example, we will see only the first `config.yml` file.
  This config breaks our orb's CI pipeline into two workflows, "test-pack", and "test-deploy".
  "test-pack" will lint, shellcheck, and review our orb, before triggering the "test-deploy" workflow with the orb injected for e2e testing.
  See the list of jobs for a detailed description of each job.
  "test-deploy" is found in the `./circleci/test-deploy.yml` file. See step 2 for more information.
