  The Orb-Tools orb is typically configured automatically by the Orb Development Kit. After initializing a new orb, this is the configuration file that will be automatically loaded.
  This configuration uses "Dynamic Config" with two different configuration files, so here we will see only the first `config.yml` file.
  This config breaks our orb's CI pipeline into two workflows, "test-pack", and "test-deploy".
  "test-pack" will lint, shellcheck, and review our orb, before publishing a new development version of the orb and triggering the "test-deploy" workflow.
  See the list of jobs for a detailed description of each job.
  "test-deploy" deploy is found in the `./circleci/test-deploy.yml` file. See step 2 for more information.
