  Use the lint, pack, publish-dev, and trigger-integration-workflow jobs
  to lint a destructured orb's YAML source code, pack it into a single
  orb.yml file, release a @dev:alpha version of the orb, and trigger
  an integration testing workflow that will run against the new dev
  release of the orb. After running integration tests, use the orb's
  dev-promote-prod job to promote the orb's @dev:alpha release to a
  production release. See the orb's GitHub README for a version of this
  example with extensive usage and context comments:
  https://github.com/circleci-public/orb-tools-orb#examples

    # publish manually once before this worklow can succeed)
